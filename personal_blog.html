            Today, I am working on <strong>SA13-act1</strong> for my CS3
            class. I am hoping that the styling element of
            this assignment is simpler than it looks because
            I have never worked with html before.<br>I am going
            to use this opportunity to try some features in the notes.

            I turned in my midterm project yesterday and
            I am very glad that it is done. Or, at the very
            least, as done as it is going to get. I don't think
            I have coded anything as intense as that in my
            entire curriculum yet. Even though it was a lot
            of work and I rather not have to do it in the first
            place, I am relatively pleased at what I was able to accomplish
            especially since ruby is not my main language.
